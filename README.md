Hi there, a PhD student over at the laboratory of Medicinal Chemistry, Rega Institute for Medical Research at the KU Leuven.

Pharmaceutical Sciences with a degree in Drug Design and Development, turned towards computer sciences.\
I work primarily through numerical programming, scripting methods and to make predictions on biochemical reality through computational experiments.


### Research
My main focus is on the computational characterisation of nucleic acids\
 `comp chem` `comp bio` `(bio) informatics`\
 `chemistry` `linear algebra` `biology` `biotechnology`

I work through static and dynamic modeling approaches, with the intent on making biological systems suitable by predicting the viability of said systems.
