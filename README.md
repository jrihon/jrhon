Hi there, a PhD student over at the laboratory of Medicinal Chemistry, Rega Institute for Medical Research at the KU Leuven.

Pharmaceutical Sciences with a degree in Drug Design and Development, turned towards computer sciences.\
I work primarily through numerical programming, scripting methods and predict biochemical reality through computational experiments.


## Research
My main focus is on the computational characterisation of nucleic acids and protein engineering\
 `comp chem` `comp bio` `(bio) informatics`\
 `chemistry` `linear algebra` `biology` `biotechnology`

I work through static and dynamic modeling approaches, with the intent on making biological systems suitable by predicting the viability of said systems.

## Skills
- Author of `jrihon/mutineer.vim` : Commenting in Vim made easier
- `python 3`
- `(Neo)Vim`
- `LaTeX`
- `Shell`
- `.dotfile configuration`


## .dotfiles

### Nvim
Neovim configuration, written in Lua. Using LSP support and `cmp`-based completion engine.
<br/>
Build everything from source.


### Starship prompt
The `Starship` prompt is available over at [Starship](https://starship.rs/)

I use two different prompts. One for everyday and one for when I am inside TMUX. This to not confuse my workflow and to make myself aware I am working inside TMUX.


### TMUX

I recommend installing bash-completion and adding a tmux completion tool `imomaliev/tmux-bash-completion` to it to make it faster to work with tmux.<br/> 
I use tmux for a more rapid and easier workflow, to maintain the orientation of multiple projects at the same time. It is also much clearer than having several terminal tabs open.
<br/>
<br/>
I use the tmux-plugin manager `github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm` and the tmux-resurrect `tmux-plugins/tmux-resurrect` to save session in between system restarts.
<br/>
<br/>
I use a different configured Starship command prompt when in tmux. To do so, add this to your ~/.bashrc. This assumes a separate `starship.toml` file in your .config directory.
```sh
# Initiliase starship prompt for tmux
if [ -n "$TMUX" ]; then
    export STARSHIP_CONFIG=~/.config/tmux_starship.toml
fi
```


## Homebrew
A small repository of scripts I use day to day to ease the workflow.
- `query_pdf` : searches for pdf files on my system. Usually research papers.
- `search_directory` : `cd` into a prompted directory, usually deep into the system.
- `curl_pdb` : download a `*.pdb` file into the `cwd`, by prompting its filename.
