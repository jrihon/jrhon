Studied Pharmaceutical Sciences (KU Leuven) with a degree in Drug Design and Development, turned towards computer sciences.\
I work primarily through numerical programming and scripting methods to model (bio)molecular complexes.\
I write `python3`, dabble in `Lua` for `nvim` plugins and started `Rustlang` recently.


- Author of `jrihon/mutineer.lua`, `jrihon/goto.nvim`

### Research
My main focus is on the computational characterisation of nucleic acids\
I work through static and dynamic modeling approaches, with the intent on making biological systems suitable by predicting the viability of said systems.\
